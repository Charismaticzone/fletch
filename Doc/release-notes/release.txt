Fixes since v1.2.0
------------------
 
 * GDAL now has explicit dependency on libxml2 if enabled in Fletch.
   Previously it was possibly to for GDAL to find a conflicting
   system package for libxml2.

 * Paths in fletchConfig.cmake were not quoted causing problems if the path
   contains spaces (spaces were replaced with semicolons by CMake).  Quotes
   are now added to some paths that are more likely to have spaces.
