===========================

This is a patch release of Fletch that provides fixes over the previous v1.2.0 release.


Updates since v1.2.0
--------------------


Fixes since v1.2.0
------------------
 
 * GDAL now has explicit dependency on libxml2 if enabled in Fletch.
   Previously it was possibly to for GDAL to find a conflicting
   system package for libxml2.

 * GDAL now installs it's data files into share/gdal on Windows,
   which is consistent to the install location on other platforms.

 * Paths in fletchConfig.cmake were not quoted causing problems if the path
   contains spaces (spaces were replaced with semicolons by CMake).  Quotes
   are now added to some paths that are more likely to have spaces.

 * The path to the Python interpreter is now added to the PATH environment
   variable when building Qt on Windows if Python is enabled.  Qt 5 requires
   Python in some build steps and expects it on the PATH.  Windows Python
   installations do not always put Python on the PATH globally.
