Fletch v1.0.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of Fletch that provides bug fixes and documentation
improvements over the previous v1.0.0 release.


Updates since v1.0.0
--------------------

Documentation

 * Updated the Fletch README with known issues

Project Configuration

 * Updated VTK to build with the VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS option turned off


Fixes since v1.0.0
------------------

CMake

 * Fixed support for CMake 2.8.12 by removing unsupported character escape
   sequences and replacing a .tar.xz download with a .tar.gz.

OpenCV 3.1

 * Patched OpenCV 3.1 to remove the improper use of INSTALL_NAME_DIR which
   causes packaging issues on MacOS.  This same patch was applied to OpenCV 2.4
   in Fletch and was accepted upstream in OpenCV 3.2.  Details here:
   https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/6006

 * Patched OpenCV 3.1 to fix Debug builds on Windows when Python is enabled.
   The issue was failure to link to python27_d.lib, which is not distributed
   with Python installers.

PNG

 * Prevented excessive symlinking of libraries. The process was causing issues for the Ninja generator. It is a redundant operation since the soversion property will suffice.
