Fletch v1.1.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of Fletch that provides bug fixes and documentation
improvements over the previous v1.0.0 release.


Updates since v1.0.0
--------------------

Package Upgrades

 * Updated Caffe to pull from a Kitware clone of the project and applied
   various patches to allow it to build on Windows.

 * Updated PROJ.4 to 4.9.3. Installation is now implemented upstream, which
   allows dropping our local patches, and upstream also installes the data
   files (which our patches did not). This enables use of the EPSG database
   by consumers.

Fixes since v1.0.0
------------------

 * Added Visual Studio support for Caffe.
 * Clean up CUDA, CUDNN supoort.
 * Added numpy requirment when building with Caffe and python
