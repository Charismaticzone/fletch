Updates since v1.1.0
--------------------

New Packages

 * Added ZeroMQ version 3.2.2, as well as CPP-ZeroMQ Headers

Package Upgrades

 * Updated ITK to 5.0b02 to allow vnl build on newer gcc

 * Update Qt version 5.11.2

 * Update qtExtensions enabling qtNaturalSort usage

 * Update GDAL to version 2.3.2

Fixes since v1.1.0
------------------
 
 * Fix GDAL Python support
 
 * Patched PNG to enable support for ARM64/AARCH64 processors.

 * Remove the hard geotiff requirement from VXL but fix its inclusion in VXL when user has a system version installed.

 * Disable building of VTK tests, they are not used. This decreases overall build time.

 * Enhance Ninja build support by forcing each external project to use the terminal. This prevents exponential job spawning and allows seeing the
output for each external project in real time, rather than buffering it until the entire external project build is completed.

 * Add new variables COMMON_EP_ARGS and COMMON_CMAKE_EP_ARGS for arguments that are common to (almost) all invocations of
ExternalProject_Add, and invocations for which the external project uses
CMake.

 * add_package_dependency macro now correctly checks for FOUND variable DEFINED.

 * All available flags are now correctly passed to Caffe on Windows.

 * Change the top-level CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR to be a relative path, rather than absolute.

 * Change URL of libxml to use HTTP instead of FTP

 * Disable qt-location when building Qt5, as it is broken
