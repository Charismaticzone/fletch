Fletch v1.3.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of Fletch that provides both new functionality and fixes over 
the previous v1.2.0 release.

There are many other changes in this release. These are detailed in the change log below.

Updates since v1.2.0
--------------------

New Packages


Package Upgrades

- LibKML has been upgraded to version 1.3.0. This version includes the required functions
  to properly build against GDAL 2.3.2. GDAL will now build with Fletch's libKML, if both
  are enabled. 

Fixes since v1.2.0
------------------

- Libjpeg-turbo and libtiff are now requirements to build libgeotiff. It was possible to
  try to build libgeotiff without libjpeg-tubo and libtiff enabled, this would result in
  several build errors.
